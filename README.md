# Parallel Matrix Multiplication & Cache Performance


# Documentation: 

[Report](Project2_Report.pdf)

[Presentation](Project2-Presentation.pptx)

# Prerequisities:

1. install gcc(https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)

# Steps to run:

1. Run the `build.sh` file to generate different compiler executables

2. You will see files generated in the root directory: 

      * matrix-plain(non- threaded version)
        
      * matrix-gcc(GNU version, Open Mp enabled)
        
      * matrix-xcode(Xcode LLVM version, Open Mp enabled) ( This file gets generated only in MacBook)
      
3. Run any of them to analyse the matrix multiplication 
 
      Ex: matrix-gcc
      
4. Check the results directory
